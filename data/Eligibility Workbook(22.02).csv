Tucic",2008," Sexual selection and senescence: Do seed beetle males (Acanthoscelides obtectus, Bruchidae, Coleoptera) shape the longevity of their mates?",Yes,Yes,No,,No,3,"While there is monoandrous lines, these lines were not enforced and choice still existed. Put post-cop choice may be stronger in other lines. This is a strange setup and may be hard to compare with other studies"

"Sharp, N. P. and A. F. Agrawal",2008, Mating density and the strength of sexual selection against deleterious alleles in Drosophila melanogaster,No,,,,No,1,One generation w/ gene freq. Also no enforced monogamy

"Simmons, L. W. and R. C. Firman",2014, Experimental Evidence for the Evolution of the Mammalian Baculum by Sexual Selection,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,4,"States that ""Far less is known of the fitness consequences of variation in baculum morphology for mammals."" - No direct link with fitness advantage. Genital morphology not used in this meta-analysis"

Simmons",2013, Sexual selection and the evolution of secondary sexual traits: sex comb evolution in Drosophila,Yes,Yes,Yes ,No,No,4,In D. pseudo monogamy was enforced. Sex combs are cited as having  positive fitness effects at high and low numbers. Would not give an accurate representation of a fitness comparison
