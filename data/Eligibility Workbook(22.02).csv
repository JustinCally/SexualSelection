"Simmons, L. W. and R. C. Firman",2014, Experimental Evidence for the Evolution of the Mammalian Baculum by Sexual Selection,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,4,"States that ""Far less is known of the fitness consequences of variation in baculum morphology for mammals."" - No direct link with fitness advantage. However the size is cited as having a fitness advantage"

"Snook, R. R., N. A. Gidaszewski, T. Chapman and L. W. Simmons",2013, Sexual selection and the evolution of secondary sexual traits: sex comb evolution in Drosophila,Yes,Yes,Yes ,No,No,4,In D. pseudo monogamy was enforced. Sex combs are cited as having  positive fitness effects at high and low numbers. Would not give an accurate representation of a fitness comparison
