Behavioural Plasticity,Ambiguous,Female kicking against male harassment in different sociosexual contexts for the beetle Callosobruchus maculatus.,1,[@RN253]
Body Size,Ambiguous,"Body size was often recorded to correct for other morphometric traits (e.g. body condition, strength or testes weight). It was measured as either length or dry mass.","2,3",[@RN247; @RN127]
Development Rate,Ambiguous,Egg-to adult development time was recorded in several studies  and often alongside traits other life-history traits suspected to impact fitness.,"4,5,6",[@RN165; @RN184; @RN208]
Early Fecundity,Ambiguous,Early fecundity was measured (alongside lifetime fecundity) as a life-history trait that may impact lifetime reproductive success. It was defined as either the total or proportional reproductive output in earlier stages of maturity (e.g. within the first 7 days).,"7,8",[@RN151; @RN252]
Immunity,Ambiguous,Phenoloxidase (PO) activity or parasite load. ,"6,9,10,11",[@RN208; @RN175; @RN176; @RN211]
Male Attractiveness ,Ambiguous,Inferred from female preference tests in mice and male ornament size (coloration) in guppies.,"21,22,23",[@RN157; @RN218; @RN222]
Male Reproductive Success,Ambiguous,Measured as the total progeny sired in males.,5,[@RN184]
Mating Duration,Ambiguous,Mating duration may have variable fitness impacts based on the soiciosexual conditions and extent of sexual conflict. It may be beneficial to have longer mating bouts for a male in a competitive environment however it may be damaging for a female under benign conditions. ,"1,12,13,14",[@RN253; @RN154; @RN214; @RN216]
Pesticide Resistance,Ambiguous,"Pesticide resistance was measured both in the presence and absence of pesticides for the insect Tribolium castaneum, it was a binary measure of resistance to knockdown that was incorporated into generalized linear mixed models.",15,[@RN191]
Mutant Frequency,Indirect,Allele and mutant frequency measured at the population level.,"16,17",[@RN131; @RN180]
Body Condition,Indirect,Mean body weight of Onthophagus Taurus adjusted for body size (thorax width).,2,[@RN247]
Fitness Senescence,Indirect,Rate of decline in survival probability across lifespan.,"5,18",[@RN184; @RN133]
Lifespan,Indirect,"Longevity or survival across the entire lifespan or from a given point once under stressful conditions, such as starvation or after females mated in different operational sex ratios.","19,20",[@RN256; @RN204]
Mating Frequency,Indirect,Number of mounts by males on females in Tribolium castaneum and Drosophila melanogaster.,"9,13",[@RN175; @RN214]
Mating Latency,Indirect,Time taken for a male to undertake their first copulatory mount from the time of being first put together with female/s.,"1,5,12,13,14,24",[@RN253; @RN184; @RN154; @RN214; @RN216]
Mating Success,Indirect,"Male mating success measured males ability to successfully mate with females. Often in the presence of other males. Mating success of a male against a rival male can be determined via competing a focal male against an irradiated (infertile) competitor, the resulting proportion of eggs hatching are then determined to be a measure of the focal males success. Mating success also included measurements of mating capacity where males were continually presented with females until exhausted, the number of sequential matings were then recorded and mating offence and defence ability. The mating offence and defence capability was estimated via paternity share of a male when in the first mating position (P1) or the second (P2).","18,14,24,25,26",[@RN252; @RN216; @RN152; @RN207; @RN150]
Strength,Indirect,"Male pulling strength in the dung beetle, Onthophagus Taurus, measured by attaching weights and measuring the weight the beetle was able to pull.",3,[@RN127]
Ejaculate Quality and Production,Indirect,"Sperm quality and production grouped multiple measured outcomes together, both within a study (28) and during the meta-analysis. This includes sperm size, plug size, testes size, soporific effect, ejaculate weight, accessory gland size, motility, path velocity, sperm longevity.","1,27,28,29,30",[@RN253; @RN161; @RN167; @RN171; @RN210]
Extinction Rate,Direct,"Extinction rate was measured at the population level, either via recording the proportion of extinct lines after a given number of generations or via analysis of extinction rate over consecutive generations via the Weibull baseline hazard distribution.","31,32,33",[@RN193; @RN230; @RN196]
Offspring Viability,Direct,"Offspring viability, also recorded as egg-to-adult viability or embryonic viability, was measured as survival to a certain age (e.g. 1 year or life stage and hatching).","23,34",[@RN222; @RN228]
Female Reproductive Success,Direct,"A measure of the number of offspring produced by an individual female. Reproductive success was also described as fecundity, number of offspring produced, fertility in females and proportion.","12,35,36",[@RN154; @RN156; @RN138]
Both Reproductive Success,Direct,"Similar to Female Reproductive Success, however measurements of offspring produced are sourced from a focal male-female pair, of which either male or female may limit the number of offspring produced. ",33,[@RN196]
